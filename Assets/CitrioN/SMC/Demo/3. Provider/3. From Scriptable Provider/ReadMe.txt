This demo scene showcases how to use a custom provider for a single setting.

Instead of using a provider on the provider collection you can assign any provider
directly for a setting.

In this case we simply assign the provider for a rounded previous next selector to be used.

Check out the advanced tab for the 'Audio Setting' on the SettingsCollection for details.
