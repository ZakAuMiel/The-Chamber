This demo scene showcases the use of a tab menu.

This can be achieved just like multiple columns are achieved in the '2.1.1 Multi Column' demo.
To have a setting parented to a specific tab you assign it the correct settings parent identifier.

For the provided tab menu layout prefabs you would use 'settings-parent', 'settings-parent-2',
'settings-parent-3' and so on for the first, second and third tab respectively.
When using the provided tab menu layout prefabs those identifier are already set up or will 
be assigned automatically for the parent at runtime.
