This demo scene showcases the following UI elements:
- Title
- Headline

Both the title and the headline are essentially text elements.
By default a button would be generated for a setting that has no value.
To get text elements (labels) for our title and headline we override
the provider to use the corresponding providers instead.

Check out the provider override demos and documentation for more details.
