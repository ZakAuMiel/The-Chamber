This demo scene showcases the use of a button to reset the settings to their default values.

By default each setting that has not value associated will use a button as its
representation in the menu. You can change used input element by changing the
provider associated with the 'Void' type on the InputElementProviderCollection.
Alternatively you can override the provider on a per setting basis.

Check out the 'TODO' demo scene to learn more about overriding a setting provider.
