This demo scene showcases how to change the provider for all settings of a specific type.

In this case we assign a provider for the previous next selector for the following types:
- boolean
- string
- enum

This can achieve the look many games use these days where most input is done 
with a previous next selector. This is considered easier to use for controller input.

Check out the InputElementProviderCollection for details.
