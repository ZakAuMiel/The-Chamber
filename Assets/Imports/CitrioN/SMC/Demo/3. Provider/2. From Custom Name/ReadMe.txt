This demo scene showcases how to change the provider for a single setting similar to
how the '3.1 Input Elements Provider - Per Setting Override - From Name' demo does it.

The only difference is that we manually enter a name for the provider to be selected from the
provider collection instead of using a predefined one. This enables you to add additional
providers with different names and use those for a specific setting. You could for example have
different headings, or different types of sliders, toggles etc.

Check out the advanced tab for the 'Audio Setting' on the SettingsCollection for details.
